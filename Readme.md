### Abstract
Movies are all time favorite entertainment media for everyone. Movie Recommendation systems are very popular these days, people like to get recommendations from other users, or based on the ratings of the movie. We are building a Movie Recommendation System based on the datamining algorithms. We are using different classification techniques like KNN, SVD and Clustering algorithm like K-means Clustering. Based on these algorithms we are going to evaluate the performances and accuracy of these models.
