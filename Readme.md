### Description
Movies are all time favorite entertainment media for everyone. Movie Recommendation systems are very popular these days, people like to get recommendations from other users, or based on the ratings of the movie. We are building a Movie Recommendation System based on the datamining algorithms. We are using different classification techniques like KNN, SVD and Clustering algorithm like K-means Clustering. Based on these algorithms we are going to evaluate the performances and accuracy of these models. 

### Application 
Movies are one of the top all-time sources of entertainment. People enjoy watching, reviewing, and discussing them. For many people reviewing and rating movies is a passion. A movie can have fans and critics too. So, in a crowded entertainment market, movie streaming services and advertisers need to present viewers with the most relevant movies possible to maintain customer interest and loyalty. 
Many companies now use data mining algorithms to create a recommendation system to match users with movies they would likely enjoy
